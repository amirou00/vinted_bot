# vinted_bot
A bot that goes through vinted and sends you notifications of the products it has found.
Sorry I know that the code is absolutely ugly (some parts of it are in french too);;;;
I will accept any feedback concerning it's clean-up.

Do the following before use :
-To use it, in the beginning of the code, you will have to write 2 email adresses (the sender and the receiver). You can use your own for both of them.
-You will also have to activate your 2 step verification and insert your app password where "your app password" is in the code.
-Donwload the selenium library for python.
-Download a web-driver for chrome (chromedriver). Make sure it corresponds with your version of chrome.

Basicaly, the bot browses through the vinted website and finds certain items that you have specified for it, and if their price and score is good, it will send you a notification in the form of an email, telling you that it has found something. 
Important : the items and the filters are already fix in the code (as i had to code it for a specific person ;;;), so if you want to change them, you will have to do it (and also the web scrapping part) manualy...
Another important thing : the web elements in the vinted websites may have changed, which may actually render the program sort of useless...
So basicaly, if you want to change the filters (or that you would have to renew all the web elements), you will have to do it yourself.
sorry for the inconvenience
